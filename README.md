# 🎓 Course Advisor Chatbot (Zoho SalesIQ) – Zoho Cliqtrix ’26

This project is an interactive **Course Advisor Chatbot** built using **Zoho SalesIQ’s Codeless Bot Builder**, integrated with a custom **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** website and a **Zoho Form** embedded for collecting student applications.

The chatbot acts not only as a course navigation tool but also as a **form guidance assistant** — helping users understand what to fill in each section before opening the Zoho Form.

## 📌 Project Overview

The system was created for **Zoho Cliqtrix ’26**, focusing on a smooth user experience where:

### ✔ The chatbot guides the user

### ✔ The form is embedded into the website

### ✔ The bot suggests what the user should fill in the form

The goal is to create a virtual assistant that connects course exploration + form submission into one seamless flow.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🔹 1. Codeless Chatbot Flow

Designed entirely using the Zoho SalesIQ codeless drag-and-drop builder — no Deluge or API integrations.

---

### 🔹 2. Course Exploration

Users can browse through multiple course categories such as:

* IT Courses
* Management Courses

Each course includes:

* Eligibility
* Duration
* Fee details
* Basic highlights

---

### 🔹 3. Form Guidance Bot

Instead of asking the user to fill the form blindly, the bot:

* Explains what the form contains
* Suggests what information will be required
* Guides the user step-by-step (Example: “Keep your email and mobile number ready”)
* Then opens the **Zoho Form** embedded inside the website

This improves clarity and prevents wrong or incomplete submissions.

---

### 🔹 4. Zoho Form Embedded Into the Website

A Zoho Form is integrated into the website to collect:

* Name
* Email
* Phone Number
* Course Preference

The chatbot redirects the user to the form section on the site with a quick message like:
“Your details will help us process your request. Please fill the form below.”

---

### 🔹 5. Website Integration

The bot and form are merged into a single page using:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* SalesIQ Website Embed Script

Users can chat and fill the form without leaving the page.
